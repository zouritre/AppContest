/**
 This camera is an alias for an `ImagePicker` with `.camera`
 as `sourceType`.
 
 You create a camera instance by providing two action blocks
 that can be used to inspect what happens with the operation:
 
 ```swift
 let picker = Camera(
    cancelAction: { print("User did cancel") }  // Optional
    finishAction: { result in ... })            // Mandatory
 }
 ```
 
 The camera result contains the picked image, which you then
 can use in any way you want.
 
 You can use a ``SheetContext`` to easily present the camera
 as a modal sheet.
