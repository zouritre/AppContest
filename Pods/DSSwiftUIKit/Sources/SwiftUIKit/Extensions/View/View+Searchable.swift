public extension View {

    /**
     Marks this view as searchable if the provided condition
     is `true`, which configures a search field for the view.

     `IMPORTANT` The extension uses an `if` clause to toggle
     between the searchable and non-searchable view. Do only
     use conditional views when you know the implications of
     doing so, such as how the view hierarchy is affected.

     - Parameters:
       - condition: Whether or not to make the view conditional.
       - text: The text to display and edit in the search field.
       - placement: The preferred placement of the search field.
       - prompt: The prompt of the search field, which provides users with guidance on what to search for.
