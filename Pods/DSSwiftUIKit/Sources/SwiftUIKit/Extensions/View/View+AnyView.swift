     Wrap the view in an `AnyView`. This lets you chain on a
     modifier than to wrap it, which makes the code cleaner.

     `IMPORTANT` You mustn't misuse `AnyView` in SwiftUI. It
     messes up the view hierarchy, which will mess up things
     like animations, state etc. However, when you MUST have
     an `AnyView`, this is convenient.
