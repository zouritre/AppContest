/**
 This panel view simulates a macOS side panel.
 
 The view can be used together with a ``DetailPanelPresenter``
 to build a macOS window that has leading master content and
 a trailing detail info panel, that can be opened and closed.
 It takes care of applying the panel background and applying
 an animation that is used when the panel is opened.
 
 To simplify things even further, the ``DetailPanelContainer``
 can be used to specify both the main content as well as the
 panel content, and the minimum size of both content.
 
 Note that the view only simulates the native macOS behavior
 since it's currently hard to implement with SwiftUI. We can
 hopefully deprecate this soon, provided that Apple provides
 us with improved apis.
