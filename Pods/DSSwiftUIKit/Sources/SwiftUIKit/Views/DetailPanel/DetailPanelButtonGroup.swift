/**
 This view is meant to be used in a ``DetailPanel`` and will
 mimic the provided buttons horizontally, in a way that aims
 to mimic the look of a native, segmented button group.
 
 This approach is currently needed since the only way to get
 a segmented group is to use a picker, which only supports a
 single selection.
 
 Note that this is an experimental feature that's used while
 the native approach results in a faulty design. This may be
 deprecated in a future version.
