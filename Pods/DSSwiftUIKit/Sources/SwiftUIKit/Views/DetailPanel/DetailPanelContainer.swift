/**
 This container view simulates a macOS screen with a leading
 main content and a trailing detail info panel.
 
 The view can be used together with a ``DetailPanelPresenter``
 to build a macOS window that has a leading main content and
 a trailing detail info panel, that can be opened and closed.
 It takes care of wrapping the content and panel view within
 an `HSplitView` and applying the correct frame to the views.
 
 The `panel` view is a custom view, which means that you can
 use any view as detail panel. The ``DetailPanel`` view is a
 good view to use to simulate a macOS detail panel.
 
 Note that the view only simulates the native macOS behavior
 since it's currently hard to implement with SwiftUI. We can
 hopefully deprecate this soon, provided that Apple provides
 us with improved apis.
