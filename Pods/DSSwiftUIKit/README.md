## About SwiftUIKit

SwiftUIKit adds extra functionality to `SwiftUI`, like extensions to existing types and completely new views, pickers, utilities, services, etc.

You can explore the various sections in the [documentation][Documentation] and the demo app.

`IMPORTANT` Moving to 3.0, many parts will be moved from this library to separate libraries. The old types will be left as deprecated until 3.0 and refer you to the new libraries.



## Supported Platforms

SwiftUIKit supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.  



## Installation

SwiftUIKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/SwiftUIKit.git
```

or with CocoaPods:

```
pod DSSwiftUIKit
```

You can also clone the repository and build the library locally.



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library.

The online documentation is currently iOS-specific. To generate documentation for other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.



## Demo Application

This project has a demo app that lets you explore the library on iOS and macOS. To try it out, just open and run `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj`.



## Support

You can sponsor this project on [GitHub Sponsors][Sponsors] or get in touch for paid support.
